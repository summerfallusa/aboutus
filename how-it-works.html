	<h1>How It Works</h1>
	<p>Our web application is designed to help you collect and visualize your health data in a simple and effective way. Here's how it works:</p>
	<h2>Registration</h2>
	<p>The first step to using our web application is to register with your email address. We don't collect any identifying information about you, so you can use any email address you like. Once you've registered, you'll be able to access our study plans and select one that suits your needs.</p>
	<h2>Select a Study Plan</h2>
	<p>We offer several study plans that vary in duration and assessment frequency. You can select a study plan that best suits your needs and preferences. Each study plan includes a set of survey questionnaires that you will be asked to complete at specific times. You can choose to complete the surveys using our web application or through email, depending on your preferences.</p>
	<h2>Complete Survey Questionnaires</h2>
	<p>Once you've selected a study plan, you'll be asked to complete a series of survey questionnaires at specific times. These questionnaires will help us collect data about your health and well-being over time. You'll be able to see your survey responses in your personal dashboard.</p>
	<h2>Visualize Your Responses Over Time</h2>
	<p>Your personal dashboard will display your survey responses over time, so you can visualize changes in your health and well-being. You'll be able to see trends in your responses and track your progress over the course of the study. Our web application uses secure and anonymous data storage to ensure that your information is kept private and confidential.</p>
