	<p>We only collect the health data that you choose to provide us through our web application.

	<p>We use the data you provide to us to improve our product and provide insights that may be beneficial to you or others. We will not share or sell your data to any third parties, and we will only use it for the purpose it was intended.</p>
	<h2>How to protect your identity</h2>
	<p>We encourage you to use an email address that is not linked to your identity when you interact with our web application. This will help to further protect your privacy and ensure that your data cannot be linked back to you. We also want to assure you that our web application is designed to run in a double-blinded way, which means that we will not know your identity, and you will not know who we are.</p>
