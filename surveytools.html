	<h1>Survey Tools</h1>
	<p>Our web application uses several survey tools to help us collect human-generated health data. These tools are designed to provide us with valuable insights that can help us improve our product and provide better support to our users.</p>
	<h2>PHQ (Patient Health Questionnaire)</h2>
	<p>The PHQ is a widely used tool for screening, diagnosing, and monitoring depression. It is a self-report questionnaire that asks patients about their symptoms and functional impairment. We use the PHQ to collect data from our users that can help us understand their mental health status and provide better support.</p>
	<h2>Big-10 Personality Questionnaire</h2>
	<p>The Big-10 Personality Questionnaire is a personality assessment tool that measures the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. We use this questionnaire to collect data from our users that can help us better understand their personality and tailor our support to their needs.</p>
	<h2>Other Survey Tools</h2>
	<p>In addition to the PHQ and Big-10 Personality Questionnaire, we may use other survey tools to collect data from our users. These tools may vary depending on the specific needs of our users and the insights we are trying to gather.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the survey tools we use, please contact us using the information provided on our Contact Us page.</p>
